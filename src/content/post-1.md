Hi and welcome to my blog!  My name's Susanna and I'm a frontend software developer.  I graduated from the coding bootcamp, Code Fellows, and will begin working there as a TA on June 1st. My hope with this blog is to share my learning and experiences as a new software developer as well as sharing random bits about my life outside of my career.

To kick off this blog, I'd like to give some background on myself.  Before I went to school for software development, I worked with cats at an animal shelter.  I loved that work and am still very passionate about animal welfare, but I felt it was time to do something new in my life.  I wanted a career that would allow me the opportunity to constantly learn something new and that would challenge me. I decided to give software developemtn a go because some of my family memebers are software developers.  I quickly realized that it was exactly what I was looking for.  Learning software development has pushed me in ways that I've never experience before and I'm grateful for that.

Outside of my career I enjoy practicing yoga, crocheting blankets, gardening, and spending time with my husband and our 3 cats.

I look forward to seeing where my career in software development takes me and can't wait to share my learning here.
